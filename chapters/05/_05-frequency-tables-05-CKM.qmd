## The Cell Key Method

### Frequency Tables
The Cell Key Method is a post tabular perturbative disclosure control method, that adds noise to the original table cell values. The protection effect arises from the uncertainty of a data attacker about whether and, if so, how much a value has been changed. Therefore, all published figures must be perturbed with the Cell Key Method, even those that do not pose a disclosure risk per se. But before the Cell Key Method can be applied, one has to consider, which maximum deviation is still acceptable and how large the variance of the noise should be. But one should always keep in mind that a low maximum deviation also leads to less protection and hence one cannot focus on information loss alone. It is especially risky to publish the maximum deviation, since a data attacker can use this information to draw further conclusions.


| orig. value | pert. value | prob. of occurrence | noise | lower bound | upper bound |
|------------:|------------:|--------------------:|------:|------------:|------------:|
|           0 |           0 |                   1 |     0 |           0 |           1 |
| 1 | 0 | 0.5 | -1 | 0 | 0.5 |
| 1 | 2 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.5 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 0.8 | 0 | 0 | 0.8 |
| 2 | 3 | 0.2 | 1 | 0.8 | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | 0.3 | -1 | 0 | 0.3 |
| 3 | 3 | 0.4 | 0 | 0.3 | 0.7 |
| 3 | 4 | 0.3 | 1 | 0.7 | 1 |

: Fictional example of a p-table {#tbl-ckm_p_table}


To illustrate how the Cell Key Method is used, Table @tbl-ckm_p_table shows a purely fictional manually created perturbation table with a maximum deviation of 1 and without ones in the results after perturbation. As you can see the values in the colum ‘original value’ range from 0 to 3. This is because a different distribution is stored in the p-table for each of these values. Otherwise, negative values could arise, for example. This means that within a p-table several probability distributions for the noise are stored, which are used depending on the original value. In the given example for an original value of 1 the noise ‘\textit{v}’ is defined as a uniform distribution on the set $\lbrace -1,1\rbrace$, whereas for an original value of 2 with a probability of 80\% the noise is 0 and with a probability of 20\% it is 1. For every original value which is at least 3 the lowest lines in the p table  will be used to define the noise ‘\textit{v}’, which encode a symmetric distribution on $\lbrace -1,0,1\rbrace$.

| ID | Sex | Record Key |
|:---|----:|-----------:|
| A | male | 0.9 |
| B | male | 0.3 |
| C | male | 0.6 |

: Exemplary Microdata {#tbl-ckm_respondents}


Now if we have a set of microdata which contains three male respondents with Record Keys 0.5, 0.3 and 0.4 respectively, as shown in Table @tbl-ckm_respondents, then in a table cell that aggregates those three respondents the corresponding sum of Record Keys is 0.9+0.3+0.6=1.8. Since for the Cell Key the digits before the decimal point are irrelevant, we get a corresponding Cell Key of 0.8. Now to identify the noise that has to be added to the original count of 3, we have to concentrate on those lines of the p-table, for which the original value is 3 and identify that line for which $\textit{'lower bound'} < 0.8 \leq \textit{'upper bound'}$. This is the last row of our exemplary table, in which the value 1 is given for the noise. Hence the perturbed count for this cell computes as
\[
\hat{n}=n+v=3+1 = 4.
\]
At this point, it must be pointed out that if, in addition to frequencies, magnitudes and mean values are also published, the mean values must not be shown as original values, since otherwise the frequency values can be disclosed. 


### Publication of mean values

In this section, we will explain why original means must not be published when the Cell Key Method is applied to frequency counts. We will illustrate this with an example and show ways to protect the mean values.
For this purpose we consider a certain population group of size $n$ and for every person $i\in {1,\ldots ,n}$ of this population we denote their corresponding age with $x_i$. So the average age of this population group can be written as  $\frac{1}{n}\cdot\sum_{i=1\ldots n} x_i$.
We now consider the following example scenario, in which both (perturbed) frequencies and (original) mean values are published. Table @tbl-ckm_mean shows both the perturbed and the original frequency counts, as well as information about the age.


| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Marginal |
|:-------|-------:|---------:|
| Original Count ($n$) | 8 | 12 | 20 |
| Perturbed Count ($\hat{n}$) | 9 | 14 | 19 |
| Original Sum of Ages ($x$) | 90 | 95 | 185 |
| Original Mean of Ages ($x/n$) | 11.25 | 7.9167 | 9.25 |

: An example table with (perturbed) ages and counts {#tbl-ckm_mean}


Attackers now have the perturbed frequencies as well as the original mean values at their disposal. In our attack scenario, we also assume that attackers know that the maximum deviation of the frequency count is 2. Attackers can therefore conclude that the original case numbers of the inner cells must be between 7 and 11 and between 12 and 16, respectively, and that the marginal must have originally had a value between 17 and 21. For an attacker, this results in the following possible combinations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The marginal is originally 19 and the inner cells are
	\begin{itemize}
    \item 7 and 12
\end{itemize}
    \item The marginal is originally 20 and the inner cells are
	\begin{itemize}
    \item 7 and 13
    \item 8 and 12
\end{itemize}
    \item The marginal is originally 21 and the inner cells are
	\begin{itemize}
    \item 7 and 14
    	    \item 8 and 13
	    \item 9 and 12
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


* The marginal is originally 19 and the inner cells are
    + 7 and 12
* The marginal is originally 20 and the inner cells are
    + 7 and 13
    + 8 and 12
* The marginal is originally 21 and the inner cells are
    +7 and 14
	+ 8 and 13
	+ 9 and 12

The attackers can now multiply the original mean values of the table cells known to them with the thus calculated candidates for the associated frequencies. In this way, they obtain estimations for the original magnitude value for each cell. If now for each of those estimations, they sum up those values for the inner cells, they obtain another estimated value for the marginal value. This can now be used to identify the correct combination of frequency values, since for the correct ones the sum over the inner cell values is identical to the marginal value, as shown in table ?.


| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Marginal | Est. Cell 1 | Est. Cell 2 | Sum of Estimates | Est. Marginal |
|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|-:|
| 7 | 12 | 19 | 78.75 | 95 | 173.75 | 175.75 |
| 7 | 13 | 20 | 78.75 | 102.917 | 181.667 | 185 |
| 8 | 12 | 20 | 90 | 95 | 185 | 185 |
| 7 | 14 | 21 | 78.75 | 110.833 | 189.583 | 194.25 |
| 8 | 13 | 21 | 90 | 102.917 | 192.917 | 194.25 |
| 9 | 12 | 21 | 101.25 | 95 | 196.25 | 194.25 |

: Sample calculation for an attacker {#tbl-ckm_attacker}



Additionally, through this calculation, the associated magnitude values are now known as well. If these are confidential, a further problem arises. The publication of original mean values is therefore not recommended.
So, when using the Cell Key Method for frequency tables one has to use those perturbed counts, when generating mean values, i.e. if $n$ is an original count, $\hat{n}$ is the corresponding perturbed count and $m$ is the corresponding magnitude value, as it gets published, then the mean has to be calculated as $\frac{m}{\hat{n}}$.
